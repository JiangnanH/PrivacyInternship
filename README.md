## WGAN-GP
Based on the original implementation (available on this [repository](https://github.com/igul222/improved_wgan_training)) of WGAN with gradient proposed by Gulrajani et al. in [Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028)
We have added support to train with the original NIST dataset after applying some preprocessing.
