I am sorry I means the original NIST dataset (not MNIST), which is somewhat bigger. https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19  It includes writer IDs, which we need.  There is also this variant https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset but I am not sure it comes with writer IDs: to be verified. I think it does: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05373.pdf
